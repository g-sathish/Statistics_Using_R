  Output: "Welcome to \"Statistics using R\" course !! The main objective of the course is to provide the students with the skills to use R for processing and analyzing quantitative data and to coach the students to process data and generate statistics for testing for differences between variables."

- Class: text 
  Output: "In this lesson, we will load the data (in csv format) and perform                         
           1. Type Conversions, 
           2. Labelling, 
           3. Dealing with Missing Values, 
           4. Data Types, 
           5. Descriptive Statistics and Charts (Bar chart, Scatter Plot and Histogram)." 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As a first step towards our analysis, let us add a dataset called 'arbuthnot'.
  CorrectAnswer: data(arbuthnot)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data("arbuthnot")', 'data(arbuthnot)')
  Hint: Type data(arbuthnot) and press Enter.

- Class: text 
  Output: "The Arbuthnot data set refers to Dr. John Arbuthnot, an 18th century 
  physician, writer, and mathematician. He was interested in the ratio of newborn
  boys to newborn girls, so he gathered the baptism records for children born in
  London for every year from 1629 to 1710."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can take a look at the data by typing its name into the console.
  CorrectAnswer: arbuthnot
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('arbuthnot')
  Hint: Type arbuthnot and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: "However printing the whole dataset in the console is not that useful. One advantage of RStudio is that it comes with a built-in data viewer. Click on
the name `arbuthnot` in the Environment pane (upper right window) that lists the objects in your workspace. This will bring up an alternative display of the 
data set in the Data Viewer (upper left window). You can close the data viewer by clicking on the x in the upper lefthand corner"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Go on and click the arbuthnot data set from the global environment data pane.
  CorrectAnswer: View(arbuthnot)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('View(arbuthnot)','view(arbuthnot)')
  Hint: Type View(arbuthnot) and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: "Now, in the dataset, What you should see are four columns of numbers, each row representing a different year; the first entry in each row is simply the row number (an index 
we can use to access the data from individual years if we want), the second is the year, and the third and fourth are the numbers of boys and girls baptized 
that year, respectively"

- Class: text
  Output: "Note that the row numbers in the first column are not part of Arbuthnot's data. 
R adds them as part of its printout to help you make visual comparisons. You can
think of them as the index that you see on the left side of a spreadsheet. In 
fact, the comparison to a spreadsheet will generally be helpful. R has stored 
Arbuthnot's data in a kind of spreadsheet or table called a data frame."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can see the dimensions of this data frame by typing dim(arbuthnot)
  CorrectAnswer: dim(arbuthnot)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('dim(arbuthnot)')
  Hint: Type dim(arbuthnot) and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: "This command should output `[1] 82 3`, indicating that there are 82 rows and 3 
columns (we'll get to what the `[1]` means in a bit), just as it says next to 
the object in your workspace"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can see the names of these columns (or variables) by typing names(arbuthnot)
  CorrectAnswer: names(arbuthnot)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('names(arbuthnot)')
  Hint: Type names(arbuthnot) and press Enter.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: How many variables are included in this data set? 
  CorrectAnswer: 3
  AnswerChoices: 2; 3; 4; 82; 1710
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='3')
  Hint: 'Variables are the labels of each column. Do not count the first printout like column with row numbers as a variable.'

- Class: text
  Output: "Now, let's find what are the years that are included in the dataset.? "
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can take a look at the year variable in the Data Viewer to answer this question. However, I would recommend you to use count() to answer this question.
  CorrectAnswer: count(arbuthnot, year)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('count(arbuthnot, year)')
  Hint: Type count(arbuthnot, year) and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: "You should see that the data frame contains the columns `year`,  `boys`, and 
`girls`. At this point, you might notice that many of the commands in R look a 
lot like functions from math class; that is, invoking R commands means supplying
a function with some number of arguments. The `dim` and `names` commands, for 
example, each took a single argument, the name of a data frame."

- Class: text
  Output: "Let's start to examine the data a little more closely."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can access the data in a single column of a data frame separately using a command like arbuthnot$boys
  CorrectAnswer: arbuthnot$boys
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('arbuthnot$boys')
  Hint: Type arbuthnot$boys and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: "This command will only show the number of boys baptized each year. The dollar
sign basically says 'go to the data frame that comes before me, and find the 
variable that comes after me'"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What command would you use to extract just the counts of girls born? 
  CorrectAnswer: arbuthnot$girls
  AnswerChoices: arbuthnot$girls; arbuthnot$boys; girls; arbuthnot[girls]; $girls
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='arbuthnot$girls')
  Hint: 'Remember how we accessed the single column boys from the data frame.'

- Class: figure
  Output: R has some powerful functions for making graphics. We can create a simple plot of the number of girls baptized per year with the command "ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = girls)) + geom_point()"
  Figure: draw.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: "Before we review the code for this plot, let's summarize the trends we see in the data."
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following best describes the number of girls baptised over the years included in this dataset?
  AnswerChoices: There appears to be no trend in the number of girls baptised from 1629 to 1710;There is initially an increase in the number of girls baptised, which peaks around 1640. After 1640 there is a decrease in the number of girls baptised, but the number begins to increase again in 1660. Overall the trend is an increase in the number of girls baptised.;There is initially an increase in the number of girls baptised. This number peaks around 1640 and then after 1640 the number of girls baptised decreases.;The number of girls baptised has decreased over time;There is an initial increase in the number of girls baptised but this number appears to level around 1680 and not change after that time point.
  CorrectAnswer: There is initially an increase in the number of girls baptised, which peaks around 1640. After 1640 there is a decrease in the number of girls baptised, but the number begins to increase again in 1660. Overall the trend is an increase in the number of girls baptised.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='There is initially an increase in the number of girls baptised, which peaks around 1640. After 1640 there is a decrease in the number of girls baptised, but the number begins to increase again in 1660. Overall the trend is an increase in the number of girls baptised.')
  Hint: 'Look at the plot to answer this question'
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Back to the code... We use the `ggplot()` function to build plots. If you run the plotting code in your console, you should see the plot appear under the *Plots* tab of the lower right panel of RStudio. Notice that the command above again looks like a function, this time with arguments separated by commas. "

- Class: text
  Output: "- The first argument is always the dataset. - Next, we provide thevariables from the dataset to be assigned to `aes`thetic elements of the plot, e.g. the x and the y axes. - Finally, we use another layer, separated by a `+` to specify the `geom`etric object for the plot. Since we want to scatterplot, we use `geom_point`."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You might wonder how you are supposed to know the syntax for the `ggplot` function. Thankfully, R documents all of its functions extensively. To read what a function does and learn the arguments that are available to you, just type in a question mark followed by the name of the function that you're interested in. Try the following in your console- ?ggplot
  CorrectAnswer: ?ggplot
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('?ggplot')
  Hint: Type ?ggplot and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: "Notice that the help file replaces the plot in the lower right panel. You can toggle between plots and help files using the tabs at the top of that panel. "

- Class: text
  Output: "Now, suppose we want to plot the total number of baptisms. To compute this, we could use the fact that R is really just a big calculator. We can type in mathematical expressions like `5218 + 4683`"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Go ahead and type 5218 + 4683 in the console.
  CorrectAnswer: 5218 + 4683
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('5218 + 4683','5218+4683','5218 +4683','5218+ 4683')
  Hint: Type 5218 + 4683 and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: to see the total number of baptisms in 1629. We could repeat this once for each year, but there is a faster way. If we add the vector for baptisms for boys to that of girls, R will compute all sums simultaneously.
  CorrectAnswer: arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls','arbuthnot$boys+arbuthnot$girls','arbuthnot$boys+ arbuthnot$girls','arbuthnot$boys +arbuthnot$girls')
  Hint: Type arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: "What you will see are 82 numbers (in that packed display, because we aren’t looking at a data frame here), each one representing the sum we’re after. Take a look at a few of them and verify that they are right."

- Class: text
  Output: "Now, let's add a new variable."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Go ahead and add a new variable called as `total` and assign it with the value of `boys + girls`
  CorrectAnswer: mutate(arbuthnot, total = boys + girls)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('mutate(arbuthnot, total = boys + girls)','arbuthnot %>% mutate(total = boys + girls)')
  Hint: Type mutate(arbuthnot, total = boys + girls) and press Enter.

- Class: mult_question
