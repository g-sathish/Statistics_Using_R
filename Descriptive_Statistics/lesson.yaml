  Output: "Welcome to \"Statistics using R\" course !! The main objective of the course is to provide the students with the skills to use R for processing and analyzing quantitative data and to coach the students to process data and generate statistics for testing for differences between variables."

- Class: text 
  Output: "In this lesson, we will load the data (in csv format) and perform                         
           1. Type Conversions, 
           2. Labelling, 
           3. Dealing with Missing Values, 
           4. Data Types, 
           5. Descriptive Statistics and Charts (Bar chart, Scatter Plot and Histogram)." 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As a first step towards our analysis, let us add a dataset called 'arbuthnot'.
  CorrectAnswer: data(arbuthnot)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data("arbuthnot")', 'data(arbuthnot)')
  Hint: Type data(arbuthnot) and press Enter.

- Class: text 
  Output: "The Arbuthnot data set refers to Dr. John Arbuthnot, an 18th century 
  physician, writer, and mathematician. He was interested in the ratio of newborn
  boys to newborn girls, so he gathered the baptism records for children born in
  London for every year from 1629 to 1710."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can take a look at the data by typing its name into the console.
  CorrectAnswer: arbuthnot
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('arbuthnot')
  Hint: Type arbuthnot and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: "However printing the whole dataset in the console is not that useful. One advantage of RStudio is that it comes with a built-in data viewer. Click on
the name `arbuthnot` in the Environment pane (upper right window) that lists the objects in your workspace. This will bring up an alternative display of the 
data set in the Data Viewer (upper left window). You can close the data viewer by clicking on the x in the upper lefthand corner"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Go on and click the arbuthnot data set from the global environment data pane.
  CorrectAnswer: View(arbuthnot)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('View(arbuthnot)','view(arbuthnot)')
  Hint: Type View(arbuthnot) and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: "Now, in the dataset, What you should see are four columns of numbers, each row representing a different year; the first entry in each row is simply the row number (an index 
we can use to access the data from individual years if we want), the second is the year, and the third and fourth are the numbers of boys and girls baptized 
that year, respectively"

- Class: text
  Output: "Note that the row numbers in the first column are not part of Arbuthnot's data. 
R adds them as part of its printout to help you make visual comparisons. You can
think of them as the index that you see on the left side of a spreadsheet. In 
fact, the comparison to a spreadsheet will generally be helpful. R has stored 
Arbuthnot's data in a kind of spreadsheet or table called a data frame."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can see the dimensions of this data frame by typing dim(arbuthnot)
  CorrectAnswer: dim(arbuthnot)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('dim(arbuthnot)')
  Hint: Type dim(arbuthnot) and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: "This command should output `[1] 82 3`, indicating that there are 82 rows and 3 
columns (we'll get to what the `[1]` means in a bit), just as it says next to 
the object in your workspace"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can see the names of these columns (or variables) by typing names(arbuthnot)
  CorrectAnswer: names(arbuthnot)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('names(arbuthnot)')
  Hint: Type names(arbuthnot) and press Enter.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: How many variables are included in this data set? 
  CorrectAnswer: 3
  AnswerChoices: 2; 3; 4; 82; 1710
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='3')
  Hint: 'Variables are the labels of each column. Do not count the first printout like column with row numbers as a variable.'

- Class: text
  Output: "Now, let's find what are the years that are included in the dataset.? "
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can take a look at the year variable in the Data Viewer to answer this question. However, I would recommend you to use count() to answer this question.
  CorrectAnswer: count(arbuthnot, year)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('count(arbuthnot, year)')
  Hint: Type count(arbuthnot, year) and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: "You should see that the data frame contains the columns `year`,  `boys`, and 
`girls`. At this point, you might notice that many of the commands in R look a 
lot like functions from math class; that is, invoking R commands means supplying
a function with some number of arguments. The `dim` and `names` commands, for 
example, each took a single argument, the name of a data frame."

- Class: text
  Output: "Let's start to examine the data a little more closely."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can access the data in a single column of a data frame separately using a command like arbuthnot$boys
  CorrectAnswer: arbuthnot$boys
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('arbuthnot$boys')
  Hint: Type arbuthnot$boys and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: "This command will only show the number of boys baptized each year. The dollar
sign basically says 'go to the data frame that comes before me, and find the 
variable that comes after me'"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What command would you use to extract just the counts of girls born? 
  CorrectAnswer: arbuthnot$girls
  AnswerChoices: arbuthnot$girls; arbuthnot$boys; girls; arbuthnot[girls]; $girls
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='arbuthnot$girls')
  Hint: 'Remember how we accessed the single column boys from the data frame.'

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Would you like to submit the log of this lesson to Google Forms so
    that your instructor may evaluate your progress?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
  AnswerTests: submit_log()
  Hint: hint
